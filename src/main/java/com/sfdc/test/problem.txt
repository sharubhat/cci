OVERVIEW

Your program should take lines of text input (each containing one of five commands: DEPEND, INSTALL, REMOVE, LIST, END); after reading each line you will need to echo the input and possibly output further line(s) of text, as described in the “command list” below.

The primary idea in this program is to keep track of various dependencies; if, for example, an input line is INSTALL A and you know that A depends on B (from an earlier line like DEPEND A B, perhaps), then—if B is not yet installed—B must be installed before installing A. (See the descriptions in the “command list” for further details.)

Note that when removing an item, the items on which that item depends should also be removed if and only if nothing else depends on them and those items were not explicitly installed—e.g., if B is installed as part of the installation of A (as in the previous paragraph), then once all the items that depend on B are removed, B will be removed.
COMMAND LIST

The commands below are described in one paragraph each, formatted in four small sections; specifically:

    Command syntax
    Description of command
    Output
    Description of output

    DEPEND A B [C ...]
    Have A depend on B (and C ...)
    DEPEND A B [C ...]
    Simply repeat the input line.

    INSTALL A
    Install A and all items on which it depends.
    INSTALL A

              [...]

              [Installing B]

   Installing A | A is already installed

    If A is already installed, simply print A is already installed. Otherwise, if A does not depend on any uninstalled items, simply print Installing A. Otherwise, print lines to install everything that A still needs (as well as A). Note that those items might also have dependencies, and so on. Also note that you need only print the single line of text for each item installed—you don’t really install anything!

    REMOVE A
    Remove A and all items on which it depends if they aren’t needed by anything else.
    REMOVE A

   Removing A | A is still needed | A is not installed

   [Removing B]

   [...]

    If A is not installed, simply print A is not installed. Otherwise, if A is still needed by something, simply print A is still needed. Otherwise, print Removing A and then print lines to remove every other item that was installed because of a dependency on it—rather than being explicitly installed—that also no longer has anything dependant upon it. Note that those items might have items on which they depended that then are no longer needed... Also, note that an item that was explicitly installed should never be removed as a dependency of some other item.

    LIST
    List all installed items.
    LIST

   [A]

   [...]

    A list of all installed items, each on its own line. Order does not matter.

    END
    End the input file (this should appear exactly once—as the last line of the input).
    END
    Simply repeat the input line.
