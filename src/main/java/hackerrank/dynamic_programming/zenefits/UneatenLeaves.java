/**
 * K caterpillars are eating their way through N leaves, each caterpillar falls from leaf to leaf in a unique sequence,
 * all caterpillars start at a twig at position 0 and falls onto the leaves at position between 1 and N.
 * Each caterpillar j has as associated jump number Aj. A caterpillar with jump number j eats leaves at positions
 * that are multiple of j. It will proceed in the order j, 2j, 3jâ€¦. till it reaches the end of the leaves and
 * it stops and build its cocoon. Given a set A of K elements K<-15, N<=10^9,
 * we need to determine the number of uneaten leaves.

 Input:

 N = No of uneaten leaves
 K = No. of caterpillars
 A = Array of integer jump numbers
 Output:

 The integer nu. Of uneaten leaves

 Sample Input:

 10
 3
 2
 4
 5
 Output:

 4
 Explanation:

 [2, 4, 5] is a j member jump numbers, all leaves which are multiple of 2, 4, and 5 are eaten,
 leaves 1,3,7,9 are left, and thus the no. 4
