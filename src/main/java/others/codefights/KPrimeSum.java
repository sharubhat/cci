/**
 * A number is called a k-primeSum if it can be represented as a sum of k (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers. Implement a function that checks if the given number is k-primeSum or not.

 Example

 For n = 9 and k = 3, the output should be
 primeSum(n, k) = true.

 We can represent 9 as 2 + 2 + 5.

 Input/Output

 [time limit] 3000ms (java)
 [input] integer n

 Constraints:
 1 ≤ n ≤ 250.

 [input] integer k

 Constraints:
 1 ≤ k ≤ 5.

 [output] boolean

 true if n is a k-primeSum, false otherwise.
